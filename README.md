# Unmasking Diabetes: A Comprehensive Analysis of Patient Data and Classifier Performance
<br>

## Abstract
This project aimed to perform a comprehensive analysis of patient data to predict the likelihood of diabetes using machine learning classification algorithms.

<br>

## Project Objectives:
- Conduct exploratory analysis on the diabetes dataset to gain insights into key features.
- Implement and evaluate the performance of five machine learning classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost, and Catboost.
- Utilize SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret feature significance in the models.

<br>

## Data
The dataset was acquired from the Winsconsin University database.

<br>

## Algorithms Tested
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Catboost
- Ensemble of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Catboost
<br>

## Outcome:
- Achieved <b>0.972</b> Accuracy, <b>0.971</b> f1-score and <b>0.996</b> AUC with the best performing XGBoost model.
- Identified key features contributing to diabetes prediction using SHAP value plots.
